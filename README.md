# NLP-Projekt

The goal of this project is to observe how well topic exploration works with archaic Estonian.

Gemini API is used as a backend and duckdb locally. This repository shows code used to process the data.

Main queries can be found in Jupyter notebook folder. qry_topicgpt has queries and execution scripts and analysis looks at the data for insights. As showing the code was not a requirement then the original project structure differed and notebooks are not usable without modification.

Data and responses can be seen in full_scope_data folder.
